1. [x] Implement the Agent Client Protocol support so that we can integrate with Zed
 - Refer to ACP.md for more details on what it is
 - Add a --acp flag to the command line interface to enable Agent Client Protocol support.
   - The cli should switch interaction to ACP rather than the regular cli style of interaction when the flag is set
